From Doom Scrolling to Code Rolling: My Developer Revival Story ðŸš€



## The Dark Before Dawn ðŸŒ‘
Before 2024, I was your typical doom-scroller. You know the drill - endless Douyin (Chinese TikTok) sessions, minimal life goals, and a constant battle with depression. Work was just... work. Nothing more.

## The Plot Twist ðŸ”„
Enter my colleague [@JiaLiangC](https://github.com/JiaLiangC) - the unexpected mentor who changed everything. Through his book recommendations and a beginner-friendly programming course, I found my spark again.

## The Technical Awakening ðŸ’»
2024 became my year of coding renaissance:

- Built a simplified Tomcat implementation
- Started diving into Spring framework internals
- Made my first open-source contributions
- Learned under @JiaLiangC's guidance

Sure, these might sound like baby steps to some, but hey - every developer started somewhere, right?

## Beyond the Code ðŸŒ±
But wait, there's more! This transformation wasn't just about coding:

- Dove deep into psychology and social science books
- Started a consistent workout routine ðŸ’ª
- Began learning English seriously
- Significantly reduced screen time
- Sought professional help for depression

The Results? ðŸ“ˆ

```java
Map<String, LifeState> life = Map.of(
    "before2024", new LifeState(0, null, null),
    "after2024", new LifeState(100, "clear", true)
);
```

## What's Next? ðŸŽ¯
As I step into 2025, I'm no longer that person mindlessly scrolling through social media. I'm a developer-in-progress, an open-source contributor, and most importantly - someone who's excited about the future.

## The Takeaway ðŸ’¡
If you're stuck in a rut, remember: change is possible. Sometimes all it takes is:

- The right mentor
- A willingness to learn
- Taking care of your mental health
- Consistent small steps forward
